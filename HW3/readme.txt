This project is actually on the Metal Detector System, which we usually find in high security areas like airport, shopping malls and so on. This system is basically used to detect harmful weapons or metals, to keep the place safe. Talking about the working of this system, it works in such a way that, it basically has a sensor which catches the motion of a person, and then detects whether the person is carrying any harmful weapon or metal with him or not, if it detects any metal while scanning, it transforms into the alarm mode and the alarm starts ringing, where basically the officials take that person for a proper security checkup. Otherwise, the System resets itself and goes back to Standby state.


Now talking about how does the code work:

1. At first the System is in Standby state, as there was no motion detection since a very long time.
2. Then the System detects motion, and transforms itself into Scanning state.
3. During Scanning state, if any metal was detected it goes into Alarm State, and the alarm starts ringing. Then after security checkup System resets itself and goes back to Standby state.
4. Otherwise, if everything was fine during the scanning state. The System resets itself and goes back to Standby state.
