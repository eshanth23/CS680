Fuel Mileage Sensor - One-to-Many Event Notification (Observer Design Pattern)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to implement the Observer Design Pattern where a Fuel Mileage Sensor acts as the Observable, and multiple observers (Car Display, Car App, and Car Website) receive and update themselves whenever the fuel mileage changes.


This implementation demonstrates the One-to-Many Event Notification Mechanism, where the FuelEconomySensor notifies multiple observers, ensuring they are in sync with the latest mileage data.
